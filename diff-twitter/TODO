Here are the TODO list that we have to do for publishing in general. You are able to see specific TODOs in main.py and other files.

- How to store .html files into Big Table of Google App Engine

- How to manage user ID and URL data in Big Table
-- How to deal with the case that ID is different but URL is same.

- Create main.cgi in which there are two input forms: User ID for whispering from diff_bot and URL for using "diff"
